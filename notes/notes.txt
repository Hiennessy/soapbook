Typing search in search input
1. Onkeyup - js function will run ajaxSearch with typed letter as form data to php - done
2. PHP will detect ajax request, then send back list of suggestions
   - First PHP will do a query for all soap names
   - Then run a matching function with regex and return all matches
   - PHP will then send back matches as json
   - Then either js or php will somehow draw a table of the suggestions into the box div

3. js function will take list of suggestions and display them in a div

Clicking search button
1. On click - js function will run ajaxSearch with chosen name of soap that is in search input as form data to php
2. PHP will detect ajax request, then send back all data of the chosen soap
3. js will take soap data and display, maybe in recipe card style

Clicking add recipe button
1. On click - js will open new recipe create form, this form will ask for new soap name, ingredients, etc.
2. On submitting - js will run ajax to send php form data
3. PHP will take data and insert into database

Clicking see all recipe button
1. On click - js will run ajax to tell php that it wants all soap data
2. PHP will do a query to get all soap data, then return to js
3. js will take all data and display, maybe in recipe card style

Questions:
1. When js makes ajax request, how does PHP know which request it is for (search suggestions, search button, add recipe, or see recipes)?
