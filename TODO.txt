TODO:
-- Make a PHP function of suggesting soap names from the database, based on typed input 
    -- To get soap names, will need to pull all names from db, then do something like an fnmatch, using regex matching
    -- Example, if o is typed, then find all names starting with o.  If ora is typed, then find all names that have ora, like orange


-- Figure out how to display the suggested soap names returned from PHP
    -- Maybe create an unordered listing of all the suggested soap names
    -- Could use PHP to draw the html, or JS - look into which one would be better
